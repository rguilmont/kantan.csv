import kantan.codecs.EncoderCompanion

/** Provides various instance creation and summoning methods.
  *
  * The instance creation functions are important to know about, as they make the task of creating new encoders easier
  * and more correct. There are four main families, depending on the type to encode:
  *
  *  - `encoder`: creates encoders from a function for which you need to specify
  *    a mapping ''row index to parameter'' (such as if you need to skip some CSV cells, for instance).
  *  - `ordered`: create encoders from a function such that its parameters are organised
  *    in exactly the same way as CSV rows.
  *  - `caseEncoder`: specialisation of `encoder` for case classes.
  *  - `caseOrdered`: specialisation of `ordered` for case classes.
  *
  * Note that a lot of types already have implicit instances: tuples, collections... moreover, the `generics` module
  * can automatically derive valid instances for a lot of common scenarios.
